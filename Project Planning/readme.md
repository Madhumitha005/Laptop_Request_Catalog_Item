## 1. Planning Overview

This document outlines the project planning phase for the "Laptop Request Catalog Item." The planning phase involved understanding the user's core problems through empathy mapping, defining a clear problem statement, and brainstorming a prioritized action plan to create a viable solution.

## 2. Empathize & Discover

The initial phase focused on understanding the challenges faced by users in the existing laptop request process.

* *User Pains:* Students and staff feel anxious and confused due to a lack of visibility, unclear communication, and delays in the manual approval process.
* *Administrator Pains:* IT administrators are overwhelmed by manual tracking, misplaced forms, and repeated follow-ups, leading to inefficiency.
* *Key Insight:* The core need identified was for a transparent, automated, and streamlined system.

## 3. Problem Definition

Based on the discovery phase, a clear problem statement was defined to guide the project.

* *Customer Problem Statement:* University staff and students face difficulties in requesting laptops through manual or email-based processes, causing delays, lack of transparency, and frequent miscommunication.
* *Core Issues Identified:*
    * *Manual Request Process:* Requires manual forms and email approvals.
    * *Lack of Transparency:* Users are unaware of their request status.
    * *Approval Bottlenecks:* Manual routing causes delays.
    * *Duplicate Requests:* Lack of clarity leads to multiple identical requests.
