## 3. Demonstration Flow (Video Chapters)

This is the step-by-step process shown in the video:

* *0:00 - Introduction & Project Goal*
    * A brief overview of the project and the problem being solved: replacing a manual, email-based system with an automated ServiceNow workflow.

* *0:25 - User View: Submitting a Request*
    * Shows the user (student or staff) logging into the Service Portal.
    * The user navigates to the Service Catalog and selects the "Laptop Request Catalog Item."
    * The user fills out the form, detailing fields like laptop type, justification, and required date.
    * The user submits the request and receives an order status confirmation with a Request Number (REQ).

* *1:15 - Manager View: Approving the Request*
    * The video switches to the Manager's view.
    * The manager has a new approval request pending in their queue.
    * The manager reviews the details submitted by the user and approves the request.

* *2:00 - IT Team View: Fulfilling the Request*
    * Once approved, the system automatically generates a fulfillment task (SCTASK) for the IT team.
    * The video shows the IT Administrator's view, with the new task in their queue.
    * The IT Admin views the task, prepares the hardware, and assigns the laptop asset to the user.
    * The asset is linked to the user in the CMDB (Configuration Management Database) for tracking.
    * The IT Admin closes the fulfillment task.

* *3:10 - Final Step: Request Closure*
    * With the fulfillment task complete, the system automatically closes the parent Request (RITM).
    * The video switches back to the user's view, showing that their request is now "Complete."
    * The user also receives a final confirmation email notification.

* *3:45 - Conclusion*
    * A quick summary of how the automated workflow solved the initial problem by providing efficiency, transparency, and asset tracking.
